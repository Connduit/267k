# TODO
- this is the larger agent/implant that can do everything?
- it's the "monolithic" second stage
- it acts as a module manager enabling true modular loading thereafter? (it should have all of the module logic precompiled inside of it?)

### Features (TODO)
- process hollowing, module stomping (reuse existing loaded modules)
- reflective dll, module overloading (load dll into legit module space)
