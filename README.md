tcp stub

### Concepts
- listener with auto-deploy?

### Workflow
stub -> payload (establish persistence) -> full install -> profit? 

##### stub
- avoid installation / when stub is being transfer to the victim
- avoid detection while idle but installed on victim machine
- avoid detection while stub is executing / alive
- avoid detection after stub is done... clean up or find somewhere to hide?

# Counter Measures
- Ivanti Device & Application Control
- Symantec Endpoint Protection
- RTNotify?
